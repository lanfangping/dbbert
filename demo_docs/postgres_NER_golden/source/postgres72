I started my career with SQL Server and learned for many years. However, as I moved to the consulting field, I started to realize that the world is bigger than just one technology. In the real world, we often face multiple technologies together. One of the most popular languages besides SQL Server, I encountered is PostgreSQL. Today I want to share PostgreSQL Learning Path at Pluralsight where you can learn this technology systematically.Learn PostgreSQL – Learning PathCourse 1: PostgreSQL: Getting Started PostgreSQL is commonly known as Postgres and is often referred to as the world’s most advanced open source database. In this course, we will go over the basics of PostgreSQL. We will cover topics ranging from installations to writing basic queries and retrieving data from tables. We will also explore the logic of join, and a few best practices.Course 2: PostgreSQL: Introduction to SQL Queries In this course, we will learn about various data types and their impact on performance and database designs. We will learn about various table operations, schemas, keys, and constraints. We will also learn how to efficiently retrieve data and make a modification to data with insert, update, and delete operations.Course 3: PostgreSQL: Advanced SQL Queries In this course, we will discuss advanced queries for PostgreSQL. We will learn about functions and operators, type conversions, and transactions.Course 4: PostgreSQL: Advanced Server Programming If you’re a database developer looking to expand your skills and understanding of triggers, rules, and procedural language in PostgreSQL, this course is for you.Course 5: PostgreSQL: Index Tuning and Performance Optimization Data is critical to any application, and database performance goes hand-in-hand with it.
