MySQL Server Tuning
The default MySql-5.7 values fit normally for minor/middle installations.
For larger installations it is recommended checking the MySql values below that have the largest impact on codeBeamer & MySql performance:
query_cache_size = 0
query_cache_type = 0
innodb_buffer_pool_instances = 8 (or 1 if innodb_buffer_pool_size < 1GB)
innodb_file_per_table=ON
innodb_stats_on_metadata = OFF
The values below should be adjusted depending on the available physical memory (RAM) of the MySql server:
RAM: 4GB
innodb_buffer_pool_size = 2G
innodb_log_file_size = 256M
RAM: 8GB
innodb_buffer_pool_size = 5G
innodb_log_file_size = 512M
RAM 16GB
innodb_buffer_pool_size = 10G
innodb_log_file_size = 1GB
The values above are examples for dedicated MySql servers (no other services are running on the server).
If codeBeamer and MySql run on the same server, it is recommended that codeBeamer gets 50-60% and MySql 20-25% of the available RAM.
Parameter values can be changed in MySQL server configuration file. File location can be different depending on the specific installation.
MySQL server configuration file location examples:
Windows: C:\ProgramData\MySQL\MySQL Server 5.7\my.ini
CentOS: /etc/my.cnf
Ubuntu Linux: /etc/mysql/mysql.conf.d/mysqld.cnf
An example:
[mysqld]
# some other variables here
query_cache_size = 0
query_cache_type = 0
innodb_buffer_pool_instances = 8
innodb_buffer_pool_size = 5G
innodb_file_per_table = ON
innodb_log_file_size = 512M
innodb_stats_on_metadata = OFF
Please refer to https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/optimization.html for further configuration options.
Occasionally it is advised to check and reorganizes the physical storage of table data and associated index data, to reduce storage space and improve I/O efficiency when accessing the table. MySQL OPTIMIZE statement can be used on tables for achieving this. It is advised to do it offline, without running codeBeamer instance.
An example in MySQL console:
mysql> OPTIMIZE TABLE object_reference;
mysql> OPTIMIZE TABLE object;
mysql> OPTIMIZE TABLE object_revision;
mysql> OPTIMIZE TABLE task;
mysql> OPTIMIZE TABLE task_type;
Please refer to https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/optimize-table.html for further options.
