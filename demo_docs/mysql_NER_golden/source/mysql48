View wait-based response time analytics to help identify the cause of MySQL slowdowns
Traditional database monitoring tools have dashboards showing hundreds of meaningless numbers requiring extensive analysis. Current application performance management tools provide hints, but they don’t help you find root causes.
SolarWinds DPA is a powerful tool built to address these gaps. DPA also incorporates wait time analysis, so it focuses on the speed at which the database responds to application requests instead of health. This can offer users a pragmatic approach to determining what causes MySQL slowdowns.

DPA doesn’t just work in real time; it also includes historical data analysis. SolarWinds DPA can collate data points from two years ago or from a few seconds ago with one-second resolution, and it presents the results in easy-to-understand charts capable of leading to more detailed data surrounding an issue.
This historical data analysis can help you more easily identify opportunities for improvement so your MySQL optimization doesn’t just revolve around reactively fixing problems. Instead, historical data analysis can help you make proactive changes.

What is MySQL performance monitoring?
MySQL database performance monitoring is the process of tracking metrics related to how MySQL is functioning. This process can help catch issues and ensure the database continues to support the function of other applications and systems.
MySQL is an open-source relational database management system (RDBMS) based on Structured Query Language (SQL). Because it’s based on SQL, MySQL users don’t need to learn new commands to use the system. This ease of use is just one of the reasons MySQL is the world’s most popular open-source relational database server. However, admins still need to understand how to optimize its performance, which requires MySQL performance monitoring and tuning.
The basic work of a database is to run queries. When MySQL performance isn’t at the level you expect, a variety of factors may be causing the issue. It’s possible the issue could relate to hardware and a lack of memory; it could also be a problem with the way queries are being written or indexed. There might even be an issue in the cache. The only way to determine what’s causing poor performance is to monitor all the elements in your system capable of impacting MySQL performance. This involves monitoring metrics related to the database server and the speed at which it executes queries, and it involves monitoring all other system metrics with a potential impact on MySQL performance.
How does MySQL performance monitoring work?
To monitor MySQL performance, the database administrator collects and interprets metrics related to MySQL server performance and identifies when and why performance issues are arising.
The MySQL performance monitor then uses this information to determine and tackle the root cause of the problem and return performance to normal. Ideally, admins can use the insights gained from monitoring to proactively improve MySQL performance before issues arise.
There are hundreds of metrics capable of providing useful information about what could be causing or contributing to a performance failure. Some of these metrics—like CPU usage, load, swap usage, memory usage, disk usage, and network bandwidth—relate to your system.
Given that MySQL engages with the entire system, sometimes issues with MySQL can be caused by problems outside the server itself. Effective monitoring involves keeping tabs on these system metrics in addition to the plethora of performance metrics directly related to the MySQL server, like query run time, query errors, slow queries, questions, read/writes, and more.
If you want to optimize MySQL, monitor the performance of your whole system and not just the database server. By monitoring metrics from across the system, you can gain insights to help you maintain or improve query execution times.
Why is monitoring MySQL performance important?
Monitoring MySQL performance is important because it helps you make sure the database server is executing queries as expected. This, in turn, helps ensure end users don’t experience application slowdowns, and it can help keep business productivity high.
When performance problems occur, monitoring MySQL performance reports and the metrics they contain can help you quickly get to the bottom of the issue, so you can begin troubleshooting solutions.
Effective monitoring lets you do more than just be reactive when performance issues arise—it also gives you the power to proactively improve MySQL performance. With a quality MySQL performance monitoring tool, you can identify opportunities to improve your MySQL performance even if the monitoring systems are showing all green.
Beyond simply improving performance, MySQL performance monitoring can save you money. Any database application or server will hit hardware limits at a certain point. Often, the easiest fix seems to be buying more hardware. However, if there’s an underlying problem causing resources to be wasted, you might find yourself continuously spending money on more hardware and not solving the problem. By finding and addressing the underlying issues making you hit hardware limits, you can reduce your costs.
What does a MySQL performance monitoring tool do?
A MySQL performance monitoring tool is built to consistently measure the hundreds of metrics tied to the database server’s performance and alert you when an issue requires your attention.
Don’t manually search through metrics—a monitoring tool can automatically provide you with the information you need to understand performance problems. Monitoring tools are built to pull out and correlate the relevant metrics to give you a complete picture of your MySQL performance. From system metrics like CPU and memory to specific metrics about queries, questions, logs, errors, and more, a MySQL performance monitor tool is designed to track everything and alert you when the system crosses problematic thresholds.
Beyond sending alerts, a quality performance monitoring tool can help you identify the root cause of performance issues. By directing you to the proper metrics, it can help you better focus your efforts.
Unlike regular monitoring, which only lets you see current performance metrics, a good MySQL performance monitoring tool provides historical trend analysis, so you can see whether the problems you’re experiencing have a historical precedent. Without this analysis, it’s nearly impossible to identify how performance has changed, what’s normal, and what has caused problems in the past.
How does MySQL performance monitoring work in DPA?
SolarWinds® Database Performance Analyzer for MySQL is designed to take the heavy lifting out of MySQL performance monitoring. The tool is built to monitor metrics specific to MySQL and those related to your broader system, collecting and correlating the ones most important to optimizing MySQL performance and alerting you when a metric demands your attention.
With DPA, you can easily isolate and target the root cause of performance issues. With the tool’s historical trend analysis, you can see how performance has changed and whether the problems you’re experiencing now are related to past problems. If you just want to focus on what’s happening right now, this is possible thanks to the “current view” in DPA. With easy-to-understand bar charts, the DPA monitoring dashboard is built to offer you a simplified visual understanding of your data.
With DPA, you don’t have to wait for something to go wrong before you begin improving MySQL performance. DPA allows you to more easily gain insights to help you make improvements and optimize performance, even when your entire dashboard is green.
With DPA, you can rest easy knowing the thousands of metrics related to MySQL performance are constantly being monitored and you’ll be alerted as soon as any of these metrics demand your attention.
