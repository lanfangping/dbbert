SQL Server 2014 Install Guide (by Tom LaRock)
This paper discusses best practices and tips for installing and configuring SQL Server 2014 for optimal performance.
SQL Query Tuning for SQL Server
Authored by Dean Richards, Senior DBA, the SQL tuning methods presented in this detailed paper follow a simple, repeatable, four-step process. Several tuning case studies help illustrate how the method works in real applications. This methodology is a valuable time saver because it will help you get it right the first time.

5 Risks for Databases on VMware
Virtualization makes it much more difficult for DBAs to see the interaction between the database and the underlying server resources. Here are five scenarios that merit attention for DBAs with VMware.
Monitoring Database Performance on VMware
Databases are one of the last frontiers for virtualizing into a VMware environment. They can be very resource intensive, so many companies have been hesitant to move them into a virtual environment. Most of the hesitation has come from poor experiences during initial tests of VMware. Many of our customers are successfully running databases inside VMware and the key for them was monitoring the correct metrics that can help show where the bottlenecks are. This paper will review the VMware metrics that helped many companies have a far better virtualization experience.
Checklist for SQL Server® 2014 Upgrade: Ensuring the Best Outcome for Your Upgrade
This whitepaper will help you create a list of pre- and post-installation tasks to complete when migrating your database server to SQL Server 2014. Preparing and following a checklist is likely to help you avoid most, if not all, potential upgrade issues
Checklist for SQL Server 2012 Upgrade: Top 11 Tips
It can be a daunting task to put together everything you need in a pre-upgrade checklist. This paper compiles the top eleven items that you should include in any checklist for migrating your database server to SQL Server 2012. Including these items is likely to help you avoid many potential upgrade issues.
SQL Server Query Tuning: A 12-Step Program
In this white paper, Tom LaRock, Technical Evangelist and SQL Server MVP, demystifies query tuning by providing a rigorous 12-step process that database professionals at any level can use to systematically assess and adjust query performance, starting from the basics and moving to more advanced query tuning techniques like indexing. When you apply this process from start to finish, you will improve query performance in a measurable way, and you will know that you have optimized the query as much as is possible.
Oracle Exadata Performance – Yes. You still need to tune.
One of the selling points of Exadata is that you just install it, drop all your indexes and it will increase your database performance significantly all within about a week. Although part of this statement is correct, if you only follow these steps, not only do you open the door for specific queries to run slower at the start, but there is a good chance even some of the queries that are running ok now will exponentially get worse.
DevOps Essentials for DBAs and Developers
Many CIOs have embraced the need to reposition the IT organization as a strategic component of delivering world-class products and services. For CIOs in SaaS or Web-enabled businesses, an important element in this effort is the transformation from reactive to proactive application performance monitoring and management. This is accomplished by building performance into development from the start and breaking down the silos that separate teams, from architects to developers to QA to DBAs to systems administrators.

There are differences between performance tuning on a RAC database versus a single instance. In this paper, Kathy Gibbs, Sr. Oracle DBA, will explore the RAC-only waits as well as some tuning suggestions for code to help your RAC environment run more smoothly.
SQL Query Tuning for Oracle – Getting It Right the First Time
Authored by Dean Richards, Senior DBA, the SQL tuning methods presented in this paper are derived from years of SQL tuning and Oracle database performance consulting. The methodology follows a simple, repeatable, four-step process and is a valuable time saver because you’ll get it right the first time.

Microsoft SQL Server Extended Events, a replacement for Trace, can provide you with a useful and very customizable framework for managing very technical, low-level event information about a SQL Server database and its instances. In this white paper, Janis Griffin, Senior DBA at Confio, explores how Extended Events are different than Trace, how to best use them as a deep-dive, complementary tool to a lightweight continuous performance monitoring solution such as Confio Ignite, and guidelines for getting started with them.
Response Time Analysis: A Pragmatic Approach for Tuning and Optimizing Database Performance
Response time analysis is an approach that enables DBAs to measure the time spent on query execution and, therefore, measure the performance impact on end users. In this paper, you’ll learn about response time analysis in detail and get an overview of the tools available for effective response time analysis within an Oracle, SQL Server, SAP ASE or DB2 database environment.
Five Concerns for Production Databases in the Cloud
This paper discusses five key concerns that every company should consider when weighing the costs, benefits, and risks of migrating their production database servers to the Cloud, including platform capabilities, data security, total costs (including sometimes hidden costs), recovery options and ability to proactively manage database performance in the Cloud.
A Comparison of Oracle Performance on Physical and VMware Servers
To evaluate the difference in Oracle operation between physical and VMware servers, a direct head-to-head comparison of transaction performance was conducted using both scenarios at separate times on the same physical server. By illustrating how a DBA can visualize the response time, query throughput, and server resources utilized in both scenarios, this paper demonstrates how a DBA team can effectively monitor Oracle on VMware to ensure continued performance.
