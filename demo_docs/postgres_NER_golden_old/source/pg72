I started my career with SQL Server and learned for many years. However, as I moved to the consulting field, I started to realize that the world is bigger than just one technology. In the real world, we often face multiple technologies together. One of the most popular languages besides SQL Server, I encountered is PostgreSQL. Today I want to share PostgreSQL Learning Path at Pluralsight where you can learn this technology systematically.Learn PostgreSQL – Learning PathCourse 1: PostgreSQL: Getting Started PostgreSQL is commonly known as Postgres and is often referred to as the world’s most advanced open source database.
